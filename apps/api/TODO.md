### TODO:

1. Check how to make good spoofing protection,
2. Refactor inputs and validations to the separate files
3. Write a global error handler (are Prisma 404 operational?)
4. How logger should looks (probably file instead of context)?
5. Rename prisma to db
6. enum TeamColor should be given from our file, not from prisma
7. Exclude tests from `dist` folder
8. Try to use ts-node-dev or node-dev for `pnpm run dev`
