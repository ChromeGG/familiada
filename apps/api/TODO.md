### TODO:

1. Write a global error handler (are Prisma 404 operational?)
2. How logger should looks (probably file instead of context)?
3. Rename prisma to db
4. Exclude tests from `dist` folder
5. Try to use ts-node-dev or node-dev for `pnpm run dev`
6. Docker container with production build?
7. Add jest-extended
