### TODO:

1. Write a global error handler (are Prisma 404 operational?)
2. How logger should looks (probably file instead of context)?
3. Find a way for removing old games (cron job?)
4. Add timestamps to Entities
5. Rename prisma to db
6. Exclude tests from `dist` folder
7. Try to use ts-node-dev or node-dev for `pnpm run dev`
8. Docker container with production build?
9. Add jest-extended
10. Language and rounds should be given from FE mutation (now they're hardcoded)
11. Add restricted games IDs (e.g. for `/faq` page) via .env? OR remap game to /g/:id
12. Add auth
13. Divide service in module to separate files (file per functionality)
14.
