# GraphQL Server with Fastify, Mercurius, Prisma, and Nexus Example

This repo shows how to build a GraphQL server with TypeScript and the following technologies:

- [**Fastify**](https://www.fastify.io/): Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js
- [**Mercurius**](https://mercurius.dev/): GraphQL adapter for Fastify
- [**Nexus**](https://nexusjs.org/): Declarative, Code-First GraphQL Schemas for JavaScript/TypeScript
- [**nexus-prisma**](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma/): Plugin that allows projecting types from your Prisma schema to the GraphQL schema
- [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/): Next-generation ORM for type-safe interaction with the database
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/): powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development.
<!-- - [**Sentry**](https://sentry.io/): an error tracking and monitoring tool. -->
- [**OpenTelemetry Tracing**](https://opentelemetry.io/): An observability framework for cloud-native software. Configured to trace HTTP requests, GraphQL resolution and Prisma queries.
- [**Altair GraphQL**](https://altair.sirmuel.design/): GraphQL Web Client (similar to GraphQL Playground)

The project is written in TypeScript and attempts to maintain a high degree of type-safety by leveraging Prisma and GraphQL.

## Deploy it! ðŸš¢

## DB Schema

The database schema is defined using the [Prisma schema](./prisma/schema.prisma) which defines 3 models:

- User
- Post
- Comment

## GraphQL schema

The GraphQL schema is defined with Nexus using the [code-first approach](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3).

The relevant files are:

- [./src/schema.ts](./src/schema.ts): Source of truth for the schema in TypeScript
- [./schema.graphql](./schema.graphql): Generated GraphQL scehma

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A PostgreSQL DB

### Steps

1. clone repo
2. create `.env` file and define `DATABASE_URL` and `SENTRY_DSN`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run migrate:dev` to run shcema migrations with [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate)
5. `npm run dev` to start dev server and run the API

## Tracing

The GraphQL server is instrumented with OpenTelemetry tracing.

Here's how it works:

- `@autorelic/fastify-opentelemetry` is a plugin that creates a root span for every fastify HTTP request and allows creating child spans using `request.openTelemetry()`
- `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-graphql` provides auto-instrumentation for GraphQL execution
- Additional spans for Prisma Client queries are created in the GraphQL resolvers through `context.request.openTelemetry()`.

### Example trace

### Viewing traces in local development with Jaeger

You can view traces in local development using [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).

1. Start jaeger by going into the [tracing](./tracing) folder and running `docker compose up -d`
2. In your `.env` file set `JAEGER_EXPORTER="true"`
3. Open the Jaeger UI: `http://localhost:16686/`
